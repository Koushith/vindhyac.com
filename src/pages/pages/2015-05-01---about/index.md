Hi, Welcome to my internet home :) Here you will find a little snippet of my nerdy self! 

If you landed here without knowing me at all, here is a little something. 

I worked as a software developer for a while at ITC, where I did semi-cool stuff for various iOS apps. I quickly realised, I was intrigued by other parts of the business than engineering. So I made the switch and became what everyone that cannot be an amazing engineer becomes - An **okayish** product manager. 

I have worked on **Next Billion Users**, built for India, worked in consumer high growth teams, in SaaS products that focussed on India & products that dabbled outside India too. I have dabbled in ASO, growth, user testing, preparing go-to-market strategies, elaborate content startegies and customer relations. 

I love plotting graphs and knowing what the users were trying to achieve, but I also love talking to the real users. So while I can be rigid about data, I am also **BIG** on communication. I think this is exactly why I am extremely cross-functional, collaborative & voice of the customer! I am constantly 
looking to learn, so I always try & read a little & write sporadically. I also love analysing other apps and won an [internet award](https://hackernoon.com/product-manager-of-the-year-hacker-noon-awards-2019-or-noonies-cj6z3859)
to brag about it. 

If you read this long, maybe you can will enjoy reading more of my gibberish on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vindytalks) or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vindhya-c/).
